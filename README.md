# Project "ZEN"

Welcome to the repository of the ZEN project! This project was created to develop  
an innovative banking product designed to improve customers' financial experience.

## Project Description

This repository contains code, documentation and resources related to the development  
of the banking product. Our goal is to create a convenient, secure and intuitive solution  
for managing our customers' finances.

## Repository structure

- **/src**: This contains the source code for the product.  
- **/public**: This is where the main HTML-file of the application, static resources, such  
as images for backgrounds, icons, and other files used in markup, as well as files  
that are used for SEO.

## Project management

The application architecture is designed using [Feature-Sliced Design](https://www.example.com) (FSD) methodology,  
where the application functionality is broken down into isolated 'features' or modules. Each  
feature is a standalone component, making it easy to change and add new functionality  
without impacting the rest of the application. For more information or more detailed instructions,  
it is recommended to refer to the [official documentation](https://www.example.com).

## Feedback and contribution

We welcome input from the community! If you have suggestions for improving the project or  
have found a bug, please send us your comments via the Issues section.

Thank you for your interest in our project! We look forward to your support and cooperation  
to create a better banking product.
